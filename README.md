## About
This project was designed during Deltahacks IX and was submitted to the *Google Developer Student Club Challenge* category. The primary goal of this category was to build a project that solves one of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals using [Google Technology](https://developers.google.com/products). We chose the goal of creating a web application that promotes good health & well being.
